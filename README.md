# Python-Keylogger
This is a small keylogger I made in Python to experiment with capturing key/mouse input in python and performing actions upon receiving said input.  
The keylogger takes a screenshot upon every mouse click, taking at most one every 3 seconds.  It also records all keystrokes in a .txt file.  All logged screenshots and data are
sent off of the host machine via email and the logged data deleted.  

I made this purely for educational purposes with no malicious intent and wish that this code be used for the same purpose for which it was created.
